Understanding this information, it will make the instructions in Cloud Starter easier to follow. What is the Midgard Cloud? The Midgard Cloud is a way of accessing more powerful computing resources for training and development purpose, where you use your own computer as the controls & access point. You can request on-demand delivery of IT resources instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers. This service from VAIT will allow to focus on delivering your learning projects at no cost and familiarise yourself with managing cloud infrastructure for DevOps career progression. Key Words There are some key words you should know, which will help make your learning experience much easier. Virtual Machine/Instance : a term used to describe your cloud computer. Availability Zone: this is the physical data centre location where an instance resides. At the time of writing, there is only 1 availability zone: nova . Flavor: a flavor prescribes the size of a collection of virtual machine components, such as memory and CPU. You can\u2019t select the size of these components individually, but select a flavour type (eg: small , medium , large ) which predefines the size of each component appropriately. Image: a file that contains an operating system, which is added to a blank instance. SSH: This is short for Secure Shell. It is a way to setup an encrypted (secure) connection between your computer and the cloud computer, usually via the command line. Operation System Just like your standard computer, your Cloud computer has an Operating System, this being Linux, with a number of distributions (a.k.a versions) available. At the moment, we support 2 main OS Distro: Ubuntu and AlmaLinux . This is important to understand, so you know how to find instructions and/or troubleshoot problems you have. For example, you may wish to install a particular package or software on your Cloud Computer. To do this you would search \u2018How to install [insert package name] on Linux\u2019, which should (hopefully!) lead to the instructions you need.","title":"Introduction to Cloud Computing"},{"location":"intro-to-cloud/#introduction-to-cloud-computing","text":"This section contains important pre-reading if you are completely new to Cloud Computing .

By default a VM brought up in the Midgard Cloud can reach out to the world via the network, but the world can\u2019t reach in. You need to specify any network traffic to be allowed to reach the VM via the Rules in a Security Group. Security groups can be applied to VMs at launch and can be applied or removed at any other time in the VMs life. Inspecting your Security Groups Logon to your Midgard Dashboard Navigate to Project / Network / Security Groups in the navigation panel on the left hand side. You will now see a list of the Security Groups that are available in your project. Click the Manage Rules option in the Action Menu button on the default group. A list of Rules is displayed that are part of this Security Group. Creating a Security Group Logon to your Midgard Dashboard Navigate to Project / Network / Security Groups in the navigation panel on the left hand side. Click the button + Create Security Group . Give your Security Group a meaningful Name and optionally a Description. For the purpose of this tutorial we recommend the name SSH . Click Create Security Group to finalise this step. You have now created a Security Group and you are ready to configure it with the right Rules. Adding ssh Access After clicking the create security group button above, you will automatically see the rules for this group. Two Egress rules should be visible. Egress means traffic/data sent out of our virtual machine. What we are concerned with, is who is trying to come in. So to allow our own connections, we need to add an Ingress rule for SSH access. To add the SSH rule, click the + Add Rule button. In the Add Rule dialog, select the Rule SSH in the Rule selector. Click the Add button to complete this step. You have created a Security Group and configured it with the SSH rule. Applying Security Groups Security Groups are applied to Virtual Machines to allow them to receive network traffic. Typically you apply Security Groups when you Launch your VM, but you can add security groups to your running VM at a later time too; Or indeed remove security groups from your VMs. Applying a Security Group at Launch When you launch an instance using the Midgard dashboard, the Launch Instance dialog will guide you and will ask you to apply one or more security groups. You will need to have created those group before the following the launch dialog. If you\u2019re following the Cloud Starter: you\u2019ll learn about Launching and the Dialog in Launching Virtual Machines . Applying a security group on a running instance If an instance is already running you can add security groups to the running instance to make it respond to additional network traffic, or remove security groups when they\u2019re no longer required. You do this using the option Edit Security Groups in the Action button menu for your instance.

A Public-Private keypair is a pair of files, your Private key and your Public key. They uniquely belong to each other (just like a lock and key). Your Private key file is yours, and yours alone (just like your car or house keys!). You should securely store it on a location on your computer that is only accessible to you. Your Public key can be used to authorise and authenticate you in a remote computer account. When you launch an instance, Midgard places the Public key from your Midgard account into your VM for you. This way you can use SSH to connect to your VM using the three essential connection elements: Computer\u2019s IP address The user account, The private key that is securely stored on your computer.
